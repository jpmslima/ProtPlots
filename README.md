# ProtPlots

ProtPlots is a simple and interactive tool to visualize, analyze and compare RMSD and RMSF plots of protein structural trajectories data from Molecular Dynamics or Normal mode-based geometric simulations. **ProtPlots** uses basic Python libraries and [Streamlit]() front-end capabilities. The tool was developed by EvoMol-Lab from the Bioinformatics Multidisplinary Environment ([BioME](https://bioinfo.imd.ufrn.br)), from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte ([UFRN](https://ufrn.br/en)).

> **Disclaimer:** *Generative-AI tools were used to help code correction and debugging.*

## Usage

ProtPlot uses `.tsv` files as input for both RMSD and RMSF plots. For RMSD trajectory files the first column should be the structure number and the other columns the actual values. If you are comparing more than one RMSD/RMSF trajectory you can just add additional columns into the files. The column identificator will be used in the plot legends.

ProtPlot uses interactive plots generated by [plotly](), which allows an interactive plot inspection, or export the plots as `.png` files.
